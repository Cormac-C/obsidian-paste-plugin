# Better Past Plugin

When copying text from PDFs or other sources, you often end up with ugly formatting, unwanted newlines, and hyphenated line breaks. Better paste cleans up the formatting, fitting better into your notes.

## Usage

You can search for the command by hitting `CTRL/CMD + P` then searching for Better Paste.

I also recommend setting a hotkey, I use `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + V` but you can pick something that works for you. The hotkey can be set at "Settings -> Hotkeys -> Better Paste".

## Installation

To install the plugin, go to "Settings -> Community Plugins -> Better Paste"
