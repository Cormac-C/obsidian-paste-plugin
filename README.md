# Better Past Plugin

When copying text from PDFs or other sources, you often end up with ugly formatting, unwanted newlines, and hyphenated line breaks. Better paste cleans up the formatting, fitting better into your notes.

## Usage

The default hotkey is `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + V`.

This overlaps with the 'Paste as plain text' shotcut, if you don't want that overlap then you can change it at "Settings -> Hotkeys -> Better Paste".

## Installation

To install the plugin, go to "Settings -> Community Plugins -> Better Paste"
